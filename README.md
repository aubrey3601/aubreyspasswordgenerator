# aubreyspasswordgenerator

This page helps you generate a random password between 8 & 128 characters. Right now it is compatible with random lower-case letters and the user chooses the length.

It will soon be able to allow the user to select if they would like lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters.
